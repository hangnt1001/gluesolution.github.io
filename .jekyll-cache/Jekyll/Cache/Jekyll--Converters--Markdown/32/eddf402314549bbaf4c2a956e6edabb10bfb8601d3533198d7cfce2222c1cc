<p>Have you ever been annoyed when you disconnect a machine from a domain and wanted to keep the profile for your local user?</p>

<p>Letâ€™s start</p>

<p><strong>1. Backup user profile</strong>
First you should log in as the domain admin then make a copy of the user profile you are going to mess around with (you may need to reboot your machine if the user profile has been in use).</p>

<p><strong>2. Download userprofile wizard program</strong>
Go to the following website and download a program User Profile Wizard.</p>

<p>Disconnect your machine from the domain, make sure you have a local user profile setup on the machine with admin access so you can log back in afterwards, then reboot machine.</p>

<p><strong>4. User Profile Wizard user account info</strong>

<p>The next screen will give you a list of current user profiles, to find the old domain profile you need to check the show unassigned profiles box.</p>

<p>You might find the name to the left is not very helpful but you should be able to find the profle you want from the path name to the right.</p>

<p>Click next</p>

<p><strong>6. Migration complete</strong>

<p>On the next screen you should see lots of info about changing various settings and eventually config complete.</p>

<p>Click next then finish.</p>

<p>The machine may not ask to reboot give it a couple of minutes to make sure itâ€™s finished then reboot.</p>
