## About

<p>
Welcome to the personal blog of Hang (Harry) Nguyen.
</p>
<p>
I am a professional DevOps / network and system administrator. Being a DevOps / network/system administrator is much more than a vacation or a trade. I am in love of it.

This blog archives and collects a variety of pretty amazing things. Thanks for stopping by.
